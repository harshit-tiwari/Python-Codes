A program to detrmine the type of triangle based ont he side lengths of the triangle.

import sys

def typeOfTriangle(a,b,c):
    status = 'Condition not handled'
    if (not((a+b) > c and (a+c) > b and (b+c) > a)):
        status = 'Not A Triangle'
    elif (a == b and a == c and b == c):
        status = 'Equilateral'
    elif (a != b and a != c and b != c):
        status = 'Scalene'
    elif ((a == b and a != c and b != c) or (a != b and a == c and b != c) or (a != b and a != c and b == c)):
          status = 'Isosceles'
    return status


a,b,c = input().strip().split(' ')
a = int(a)
b = int(b)
c = int(c)

print(typeOfTriangle(a,b,c))
