program to convert a decimal to binary equivalent and find the maximum number of consecutive number of 1s in the binary stream.
Input - 
13 
Output 
2

binary of 13 - 1101, hence the max numbmer consecutive 1s is 2.

import sys

n = int(input().strip())

count = 0
maxCount = 0
remainder = 0
remList = ''
while(n):
    remainder = n%2
    remList += str(remainder)
    n = n//2
    

remList = remList[::-1]
for i in range(len(remList)):
    if int(remList[i]) == 1:
        count += 1
    else:
        count = 0
    if count > maxCount:
        maxCount = count

print(maxCount)
