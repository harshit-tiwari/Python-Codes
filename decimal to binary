Program to convert decimal to binary

import sys

n = int(input().strip())

count = 0
remainder = 0
remList = []
binary = ''
while(n):
    remainder = n%2
    n = n//2
    #remList.append(remainder)
    binary += str(remainder)

binary = binary[::-1]         # binary comes in reverse order hence we have to reverse our obtained value
print(binary)



Inefficient implementation below as it uses an extra loop

import sys

n = int(input().strip())

remainder = 0
remList = []
while(n):
    remainder = n%2
    n = n//2
    remList.append(remainder)

binary = ''
for i in range(-1, -len(remList)-1, -1):
    binary += str(remList[i])
    
print(binary)
