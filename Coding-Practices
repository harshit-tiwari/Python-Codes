When we are checking for a few numbetrs to be in a range, we should use range() function instead of if-else statement.
Example - checking of a number if it lies between 10 and 20

#Using If-Else(not recommended)

    if number > 10 and number < 20 :
    	  print("Yes it is")
    else :
	      print("no")
    
#Using Range() function (Recommended)

    if number in range(15,21):
	      print("yes")
    else :
	      print("no")

#Note here that the upper limit of the range should be one more than the limit we want to check.
 if number in range(15,20) 
      is the same as 
 if number>=15 and number<20
