In Python 3, there is no datatype as long because every integer value is treated as long in Python3.

Ex ; 
        total = 0       means total is of long type, it can handle large numbers too without need of any other declaration 
        
        
        
       
x = [1,2,3]   this command creates a reference to the list which is stored in the memory of the system.
y = x     this command creates yet another reference to the already existing list. It does not create a new list. Any changes done to x
          will be visible in y too because the changes will bee done in the same list.
          
>>> x = [1,2,3]
>>> x
[1, 2, 3]
>>> y = x
>>> y
[1, 2, 3]
>>> x[2] = 10
>>> x
[1, 2, 10]
>>> y
[1, 2, 10]


To create a new list, use list() function

z = list(x)   or 

p = x[:]
