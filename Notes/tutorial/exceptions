Exceptions 
Exception is an indication that something went wrong in the code execution. Exceptions are handled in python using except block.
It is not important that the exceptions should be handled in the block in which they occur. If a particular exception is not handled in 
its function then it traces back to its calling function and if handle condition is not found there, then to its calling function and 
this way up the stack.


One of Python’s built-in exceptions is ImportError, which is raised when you try to import a module and
fail. This can happen for a variety of reasons, but the simplest case is when the module doesn’t exist in your
import search path. You can use this to include optional features in your program. For example, the
chardet library provides character encoding auto-detection. Perhaps your program wants to use this library
if it exists, but continue gracefully if the user hasn’t installed it. You can do this with a try..except block.

		try:
		         import chardet
		except ImportError:
		        chardet = None

Later, you can check for the presence of the chardet module with a simple if statement:

		if chardet:
		        # do something
		else:
		       # continue anyway

The concept of Unbound Variables
We do not need to declare any variable inn python. However, we definitely need to assign some value to a variable before it is used or 
referenced anywhere in the program. Python never allows any variable to be referenced before it is assigned a value.

	Python does not support in-line assignment, so there’s no chance of accidentally assigning the value
       you thought you were comparing.
