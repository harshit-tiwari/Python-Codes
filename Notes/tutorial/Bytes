An immutable sequence of numbers-between-0-and-255 is called a bytes object.

          >>> g = b'hrteys'
          >>> len(g)
          6
          >>> g[0]
          104

           g += b'qwe'
           >>> g
           b'hrteysqwe'

           >>> g[0]
           104
           >>> g[1]
           114
# This is because the items of bytes are numbers. The ASCII code of the character is stored.
