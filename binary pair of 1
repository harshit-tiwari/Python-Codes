Program to convert decimal to binary and then calculate pairs of 1s in binary


import sys


n = int(input().strip())

count = 0
remainder = 0
remList = []
while(n):
    remainder = n%2
    n = n//2
    remList.append(remainder)

for i in range(len(remList)):
    if i != len(remList) - 1:
        if remList[i] == 1:
            if remList[i+1] == 1:
                count += 1
                
print(count)
